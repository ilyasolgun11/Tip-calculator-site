      <h5 class="display-6">Tipping in Europe In a nutshell:</h5>
      <p>
        Leaving larger tips of <strong>15-20%</strong> is unnecessary and
        sometimes considered ignorant since many countries within the European
        Union already have laws in place to accommodate gratuity. In an effort
        to do away with tipping politics, the Netherlands requires
        establishments to include tips to their published prices. However, it’s
        common for people to still leave a small tip of about
        <strong>5-10%</strong> for good service, called fooi in Dutch. Other EU
        countries which generally add a service charge to the bill include the
        Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Spain, and Sweden. In these countries,
        tipping is not customary, but considered a generous act in exchange for
        exceptional service. Germany, Ireland, Portugal, and the United Kingdom
        do not have a strong tipping culture so leaving gratuity is up to you.
        The rule of thumb is to leave a <strong>5-10%</strong> tip unless a
        charge is included in the bill or the service is really bad. Drivers and
        bartenders in these countries don’t usually expect gratuity, but
        rounding up the bill is always appreciated. In Austria, Italy, and
        Russia, tipping isn’t regularly practiced, but it’s also common for
        people to generously round up the bill since wages are so low. Some
        tourist areas in Italy will add coperto, meaning a “cover charge,” to
        the bill, but this gratuity isn’t always shared with the staff – so, if
        you do wish to tip in Italy, leave cash to make sure the server actually
        receives it. <br>
        <span class="p-style">
          FUN FACT:In Germany, the word for tip is trinkgeld, which translates
          to “drinking money”; in France, the word for tip is pourboire, which
          similarly means “to have a drink”.</span

      <h5 class="display-6">Tipping in the Americas In a nutshell:</h5>
      <p>
        Throughout North, Central, and South America, it is customary to leave
        gratuity since tips can be a substantial part of a server’s income. If
        you’re from the United States, you’re probably familiar with the
        unspoken rule of tipping: the better you tip, the better service you’ll
        receive next time you come back. Trip Advisor recommends adding
        <strong>15-20%</strong>
        to the restaurant bill; same for taxis. Similar to the U.S., patrons in
        Canada and Colombia also tip staff <strong>15-20%</strong>. In
        Argentina, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Peru, servers are used to a little
        less, with <strong>10-15%</strong> gratuity being the norm. Most
        restaurants in Brazil, Chile, and Costa Rica include a
        <strong>10%</strong> sit-down charge to the bill (referred to as a
        cubierto in Chile). In these cases, no one expects a tip but feel free
        to put down an extra <strong>5-10%</strong> in cash since the servers
        might not receive their share. <br />
        <span class="p-style">
          TIP: If you do leave a tip in Brazil, make sure to be discreet since
          Brazilians are very subtle when it comes to business
          transactions.</span

        Tipping in the Middle East & Parts of Africa In a nutshell:
      </h5>
      <p>
        Similar to the Americas, tipping is customary and expected by servers in
        Africa and the Middle East. The amount varies by restaurant and economic
        state of the country. In Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab
        Emirates, servers are used to receiving a <strong>15-20%</strong> tip.
        Even in cities like Dubai, which requires a 10% service charge be added
        to the bill, restaurant workers expect an additional
        <strong>15-20%</strong> gratuity for their efforts. In African countries
        like Jordan, Morocco, and South Africa, wait staff will expect at least
        <strong>10-15%</strong> tip. Nicer restaurants in popular tourism
        countries like Egypt and Israel will also add a service charge to the
        bill so keep an eye out to prevent double tipping. <br>
        <span class="p-style"
          >FUN FACT: In Iranian culture, gifts mean a lot more than monetary
          compensation. Travelers are encouraged to express their appreciation

        Tipping in East Asia & the South Pacific In a nutshell:
      </h4>
      <p>
        Outside of tourist areas, countries in East Asia and the South Pacific
        do not have much of a tipping culture so gratuity is not expected and
        may even be turned down. In China, Myanmar, Singapore, and Taipei,
        tipping is deemed unnecessary; however, a few trendy restaurants in
        China are starting to accept tips, so who knows what the future holds?
        Other Asian countries, like Japan and Nepal, strictly believe good
        service is simply part of life, so tipping should only reward good
        service. In Japan, some servers might even politely refuse your tip. Due
        to an influx of tourism, countries like Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand,
        Vietnam, and parts of Turkey are becoming more open to receiving tips;
        however, tipping is still not considered customary, so it’s not a faux
        pas if you don’t leave one. In Australia and New Zealand, servers and
        drivers also don’t expect tips, but appreciate it if you round up the
        bill.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <h4 class="display-6">When in Doubt…</h4>
      <p>
        Tipping customs can change as tourism shapes cultural norms and wage
        laws change. If you find yourself unsure whether or not to tip, ask your
        server if tipping is customary. If it doesn’t feel appropriate to ask,
        simply round up the bill. There’s nothing wrong with bringing a little
        of your culture to the table by leaving something behind to show your
        gratitude. And who knows, you might be making someone’s day!
